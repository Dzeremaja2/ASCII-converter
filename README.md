# ASCII-converter
This repository contains code (python) driven primitive 2D image and video editor, algorithm I developed for basic conversion to ASCII stylized art. It also contains HLSL (.fx) code ready to be imported in ReShade and tested on games for ASCII stylization. This project is directly inspired by Acerola's ASCII shader.
